            The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a carnivorous bear whose native range 
            lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its 
            surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is a large bear, approximately 
            the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi).A boar 
            (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb), while a sow (adult female) 
            is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear,
            it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics 
            adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for 
            hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born 
            on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means 
            "maritime bear" and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food 
            of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice isv
            present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as 
            marine mammals.
